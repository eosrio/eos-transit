The discover() methods options object now takes am optional new property keyModifierFunc. 
( discoveryData: DiscoveryData ) => DiscoveryData;
Callback of this kind can be supplied to the discover function, which will allow the caller to modify the list of keys before the account lookup process happens.

## [3.3.2 - eos-transit-ledger-provider] - 2019-05-28  

Added WebBLE transport to the eos-transit-ledger-provider 

Demo can be seen here - https://www.demo.eostransit.io

See the example below of how multiple Ledger instances are initialized with different transport support. 

Note the intial testing shows that WebBLE only works on Mac OS

	walletProviders: [ 
		scatter(),
		ledger({exchangeTimeout : 30000, transport: 'TransportWebBLE', name: 'Ledger Nano S BLE', shortName: 'Ledger Nano S BLE', id: 'ledgerble' }),
		ledger({exchangeTimeout : 30000, transport: 'TransportU2F', name: 'Ledger Nano S U2F', shortName: 'Ledger Nano S U2F', id: 'ledgeru2f' }),
		ledger({exchangeTimeout : 30000, transport: 'TransportWebAuthn', name: 'Ledger Nano S WebAuthn', shortName: 'Ledger Nano S WebAuthn', id: 'ledgeruwebauthn' }),
		lynx(),
		tokenpocket(),
		meetone(),
		metro() ]

I'm not entirly sure if this resolves the problem the pull intended to fix (need to do more testing), but it was a code improvement regardless.
